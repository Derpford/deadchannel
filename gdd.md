## Story
The main character works as a checkout clerk at a grocery store. His day consists of putting a nice smile on for all the people who come through his register--no matter how inconsiderate. He has seen no reason to join the thousands of people who are "Jacked"--hooked up to the 'Net nearly 24/7, only stopping when they absolutely need to, some even hiring impressively large numbers of helpers to keep their bodies functioning while they spend all their time in VR. Some of the customers even jack in while they're in line.
Things seem to look up a bit as the main character meets a reasonably nice person--a man who thanks him for his help, and tells him that he is "doing God's work". Shortly thereafter, a minivan comes speeding into the store. Cut to the main character's living room; scattered news reports explain that the driver had jacked in while at the wheel, that he'd been scared by something inside VR and had reacted by jerking the wheel and flooring it. The main character dials a number, and asks about getting a Jack.

During the operation, something goes wrong. The main character isn't accessing the 'Net like normal people do; he's seeing the underlying mechanisms of it. And it's not a friendly place when you peel back the outer layer...

Soon, the main character finds that he can see parts of the 'Net that others don't notice, and eventually, he uncovers a plot that may destroy the 'Net entirely.

## Mechanics
### Combat:
* Five elements: Physical, Fire, Ice, Lightning, Nature
* Each enemy is weak to at least 1 element, and can use at least 1 element
* The player starts weak to Physical and can only use Physical attacks
* Early on the player gains access to "Facades" that change his weakness and abilities
* Attacking, using abilities, and other actions 'tap' a certain amount of "Soulfire" (placeholder name, may change)
* Soulfire is gained by hitting enemies with elements they are weak to, and killing enemies
* Attacking costs 1 Soulfire and deals X damage
* Abilities cost 2 Soulfire for 1X damage, 3 Soulfire for 2X damage, 4 Soulfire for 4X damage...
* Physical-damage abilities cost 1 less Soulfire
* The player's turn ends when they've spent all their Soulfire
* Enemies have an amount of Soulfire equal to the current turn number
### Saving:
Save points are symbolized by point-of-sale machines, much like the cash register the main character uses at the start of the game. It costs a certain amount of money to use a save point. Save Points have unique text upon being activated, and it gets more surreal as the player goes on
### Items:
Some monsters will drop items that can heal the player, or deal damage of a specific element, or cure status effects, or all the usual RPG stuff.
### Boss fights:
Bosses will have a "shield" that keeps them from being damaged until certain conditions are met (i.e., all the mooks are destroyed, a number of turns have passed since the boss was last damaged, certain types of damage are used on the boss).
### Exiting the Net
Combat mechanics may change once the player leaves VR. Specifics, and whether or not combat will swap between VR and meatspace, are TBD.
